# Table of contents

You can use the `Toc` component to generate a table of contents for your slides:

```html
<Toc minDepth="1" maxDepth="1" />
```

The title will be inferred from your slide content, or you can override it with `title` and `level` in your frontmatter.

::right::

<Toc text-sm minDepth="1" maxDepth="2" />
